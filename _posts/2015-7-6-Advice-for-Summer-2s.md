Title: Mid-batch advice for the new RCers!
---

Advice for Summer 2's:

Jess: Nobody will make you do anything you don't want to do, but nobody will make you do anything you DO want to do, so if there's something you want, MAKE IT HAPPEN!

Sophie: Have a series of small projects/problems that you can come back to when you get stuck or tired.

Brad: Doing things is harder than thinking about them. Don't let that get you down. Learning takes time, and eventually you will understand the thing you're stuck on.

Chris: When you're coming to RC with a fixed agenda, that's fine. But don't take that too seriously. Stay open ended.

Ann: It's OK to be homesick. Also, lock your computer.

Phillip: If you don't know which checkin group, pick one where you don't know all the people.

Laura: It's OK to feel overwhelmed.

Ellie: Write some code every day. Maybe solve small problems in new languages.

Tim: If you're having a bad day, come back tomorrow. Keep coming.

Joe: Don't compare yourself to other programmers. Try to be better today than YOU were yesterday.

Caroline: Celebrate victories BIG and SMALL

Samantha: Go down rabbit holes. You don't get other opportunities to follow your distractions!

Juan Carlos: Do small projects, especially when you get bored/stuck on big ones.

Michael: Don't be afraid to go into Church or Babbage if main space is too loud.

Ashoka: Write down what you're learning. You'll realize that you're learning even when you feel like you're not.

Kevin: Set small daily/weekly goals!

Kamal: Join us for Crafternoon on Friday afternoons. One time we made dessert.

Rahul: Appreciate the diversity. Diversity here is not just about appearances, it's also about programming interests.

Appachu: The first week is going to overwhelming because you don't know what to go after. Build something the first day in afamiliar territory.

Daniel: Take a break when you're frustrated. Take a nap, or a walk.

Brady: If you're typing a lot, think about ergonomics.

Alice: Don't be afraid to do self care. Go home for the weekend if you can if you get homesick.

Kirsten: Daily meditation at 9:45AM. Come sit with us, great way to start the day!

Nicole: This place is as cool as it seems. People do want to help you out. Time goes by too fast. If you're nervous about anything, talk to us!

April: Blog or journal: Write down what you did every day. If you feel like you wasted your day, your time spent might help someone else not waste time tomorrow! Also helps sharing experience with family.
