title: Algorithms 101: Big O Notation
---
I presented at the Nashville Women Programmers meetup on algorithms, giving an introduction to Big O notation.

My slides are on my [google drive] (https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1z45j6-zuiF4Iy67n23t_FqDqXICoccsZhNPoNY7nJTQ/edit?usp=sharing). 

Many whiteboard examples supplemented the slides that introduced Big O notation. These examples illustrated why big O ignores constants, and why smaller elements are irrelevant for large values. We started with various function formulas, and worked our way up to analyzing the algorithm for solving the handshake problem. 

A few observations after presenting on this topic for the first time:

*Everyone was so eager to learn, and it was wonderful to teach something I enjoy so much. 
*The group was so supportive and helpful to one another - everyone wanted everyone else to understand the concepts in the lecture, and to be able to follow every step of the problem solving and analysis.
*Lecturing is not the same thing as teaching. I prepared a talk, but realized that I really needed to teach. Teaching is more work and more rewarding.
*It's useful to be flexible. We hacked a glass-board to be a white board so that everyone could read my notes, and I re-tooled my explanation of the handshake problem at least four ways to try to make the solution clearer, and to explain Gauss' trick for calculating the sum of the first n numbers.
*Mathematical induction is actually a rather difficult concept to explain. Perhaps I shall devote a post to a clear explanation of the intuition and logic behind it.
