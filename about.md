I am spending the summer immersed in programming at the [Recurse Center](http://www.recurse.com), where I am teaching myself Python, increasing my Javascript fluency, and wrapping my head around the networking and processes that make computers and the internet work. When the summer is over I will highlight some projects, but you can find them on my [github](https://www.github.com/sfrapoport).

I love building things, and I prefer not to use tools I don't understand. I like puzzles and finding clever ways to solve math problems. In my previous career, I taught classical Jewish texts to students ages 6-90 and organized ritual life at a synagogue. Rootedness in community and an ongoing commitment to moral growth are very important to me.
